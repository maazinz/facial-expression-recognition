# facial-expression-recognition

This project proposes an application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in the domain of Emotion Recognition. Leveraging the power of deep learning, a robust model was developed, capable of accurately identifying and classifying human emotions from facial expressions. The CNN architecture is trained on a diverse dataset, encompassing a wide range of emotions and facial variations.

The CNN is made up of multiple different layers in order to identify a facial expression in a given image. CNNs include several different types of layers, such as Convolution, Batch Normalization, Max Pooling and Fully Connected Dense Layers. The project makes use of all of them.

The dataset was found on Kaggle. The link is provided below. However, after reviewing similar codes, and using pre-trained models, it was concluded that the dataset is faulty, and does not provide the best accuracy.
